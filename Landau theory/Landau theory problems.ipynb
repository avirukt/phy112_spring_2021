It is based on the concept of a _Landau free energy_ function $f(T,m, B, \\dotsc)$, which depends on the absolute temperature $T$ and one or more _order parameters_ characterizing the different thermodynamic phases, as well as  the variable(s) thermodynamically conjugate to the order parameter(s).  Such a Landau free energy should not be confused with _the Landau potential_, which is another name for the Grand potential $\\Psi(T,V,\\mu)$.\n", "\n", "Specifically, an order parameter $m$ is some intensive property of the system that takes on different values in different thermodynamic phases.  For instance, $m$ might depend on (differences in) average magnetization, or electric polarization, or mass density, or some characteristic of the crystalline unit cell, on different sides of a phase transition.  Conventionally, the order parameter is defined so that $m = 0$ in the higher-temperature, more \"disordered\" phase, while $m \\neq 0$ in the lower-temperature, \"ordered\" phase.\n", "\n", "In principle, in order to be able to calculate thermodynamic properties such as the free energy, entropy, or response functions like the specific heat or magnetic susceptibility, it is necessary to first determine the microstates of the system and then sum a partition function.  Landau realized that near a phase transition, much can be deduced without actually determining all of the microstates, simply by Taylor expanding a free energy function with respect to a suitable choice of order parameters.\n", "\n", "A Landau free energy function $f(T,m,B)$ is arranged to be intensive, by measuring the free energy on a per-particle, per-mass, or per-volume basis.  Landau then made the essential assumption that it is analytic and can be Taylor expanded in integer powers of $m$ in a neighborhood of $m = 0$:\n", "$$\n", "f(T,m,B) = \\phi_0(T,B) + \\phi_1(T,B) \\, m + \\phi_2(T,B) \\, m^2 + \\dotsc.\n", "$$\n", "(While this might sound innocuous, analyticity is actually a strong assumption, and may actually break down for systems in the \"thermodynamic\" limit when near a critical point).  This Landau function might be calculated by mean field theory (MFT) or similar approximation techniques, or else the general form may just be posited as a power series, retaining only those terms consistent with the underlying symmetries of the microscopic Hamiltonian.  \n", "\n", "The function $f(T,m,B)$ is not intended to represent just the equilibrium free energy (density), but rather to provide an approximation to the _constrained_ free energy, when the order parameter is prescribed to take on the value $m$.  Thus, the Landau free energy will only approximate the true equilibrium value of the free energy (density) once _minimized_ with respect to the order parameter $m$.  That is, in this sort of approximation, at any temperature $T$ the equilibrium value $m_{\\rm eq}(T,B)$ of the order parameter is that which minimizes the function $f(T,m, B)$, so $f\\bigl(T, m_{\\rm eq}, B \\bigr)\n", "= \\min\\limits_{m} \\bigl[ f(T,m,B) \\bigr]$ will then approximate the value of the free energy (density) in equilibrium.  The true, thermodynamically _stable equilibrium_ corresponds to the global minimum of the Landau free energy, while any other local minima correspond to _meta-stable_ states.\n", "\n", "Here we will explore Landau free energies for one-dimensional ferromagnetic spin systems, and in particular visualize the differences between first-order phase transitions, where the order parameter jumps discontinuously at the transition, and second-order phase transitions, where a non-zero order parameter emerges continuously as the temperature is varied.

The first term $a_0(T)$ on the right-hand side describes the smooth temperature dependence of the high temperature phase near the phase transition, and is often taken to be a polynomial in $T$, or just ignored, by considering the free energy difference $f(T,m,B) - a_0(T)$.   To keep algebra and visualization simper, we will just set $a_0(T) = 0$ here, as it does not contain the \"interesting\" part of the free energy vis-\u00e0-vis phase transitions.  The last term represents the energy of the spins in any external magnetic field.  Otherwise, in the absence of a \"symmetry-breaking\" external field, only even powers of $m$ will appear, because in the absence of an external field, the interaction energies between spins do not care about the absolute orientation, but only whether spins are aligned parallel or antiparallel.
